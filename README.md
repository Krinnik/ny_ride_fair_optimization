# MaxiMile

## Introduction
We are building an intelligent ride-hailing solution that predicts both trip duration and potential hourly earnings. This initiative is led by three key team members:

- **Zain (Product & Sales)**: Defines product vision and drives sales strategies, bridging technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Mike (Data Scientist)**: Develops the predictive models for fare, duration, and hourly earnings, feature engineering for model performance.
- **Nik (Lead Software Engineer)**: Builds the backend infrastructure, including real-time weather/traffic integration, builds product logic demo.

The underlying data includes ride records, location coordinates, weather conditions, traffic levels, and timestamp information. We visualize this data to understand patterns and validate our models.

## Product Overview
Our prototype demonstrates basic predictions of:
- **Fare**
- **Trip duration**

The goal is to provide dynamic ride-hailing insights, integrating:
- **Real-time weather**
- **Traffic levels**
- **Date/time**

These features form a foundation for a user-facing UI that helps drivers identify high-earning locations and plan more efficient trips.

## Prototype Demo
- **Predictive Engine**  
  - Combines current location, destination, and dynamic external data.
- **Backend Infrastructure**  
  - Scalable and capable of real-time information updates (weather, traffic).
- **Demo**  
  - Early investor preview to gather feedback and demonstrate core functionality.

## Modeling Advances

### **Duration Model**
- Improved approach for accurately predicting trip times based on pickup/drop-off, congestion, etc.

### **Prototype Earnings-Per-Hour Model**
- Allows drivers to see where they might earn more.
- Outperforms a baseline (e.g., naive average predictions).

### **Future Modeling**
- Plans to refine feature engineering, add more robust historical data, and incorporate surge/peak events.

---

## Next Steps

### **Integrate Nik’s Backend & Mike’s Models for a Highly Dynamic Prototype 2**
- Seamless connection between the predictive engine and the user-facing interface.

### **Secure Funding**
- Additional resources required to finalize and launch the product.

---

## Pilot Testing
- Early real-world trials to gather performance data, iterate on model improvements, and refine UI/UX.
